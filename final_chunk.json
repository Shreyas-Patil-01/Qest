Decisions of a High Court are binding within that State; a decision of the High Court of one State is only persuasive in other States. The decision of larger benches of the Supreme Court would be binding on smaller benches (e.g.A decision rendered by a three judge bench would be binding on a proceeding before a two judge bench). This principle of judicial discipline also applies to High Courts.The CPC recognises the principle of res judicata and a final decision on any matter by a competent court is binding on the parties to the litigation and persons claiming under, or through the parties.

Thus, an industrial house has to borrow short-term funds as well as long-term funds. The money- market caters to the short-term needs only. The long-term capital needs are satisfied by the capital market. Thus the combination of both money market and capital market forms the financial market. The financial market covers the instruments and institutions which provide finance for short and long period.Financial markets provide channels for allocation of savings to investment. It provides a variety of assets to savers as well as various forms in which the investors can raise funds and thereby combine the acts of saving and investment. The savers and investors are constrained not by their individual abilities, but by the economy’s ability, to invest and save respectively.

After achieving political independence, government took over the responsibility of giving shape to those coveted ideals of our economy, which were enshrined in our Constitution by way of the Directive Principles of state policy. When the Constitution was framed, the government defined its basic economic and social goals that were later on summed up in the expression “socialist pattern of society”. These ideals directed the government to promote the welfare of the society by securing and promoting a social order in which justice, equality and fraternity could prevail. The resolution was adopted at the Avadhi Session of Congress in 1954 to build the society on the socialistic pattern. “Ever since then this has been the light house of our economic policy”, “Growth with social justice” and “Social Gain not private Profit”, have been the major planks of our plan policies. These basic objectives had a significant bearing on the organization of the Capital Market. But it required effective control on government over the distribution of credit and finance and thus it could not be isolatedfrom the strategy of economic development."

    "text": "Post-Independence Era In recent years since independence, the capital market of India has substantially changed and has been changing for the better. The concentrated efforts on the part of the government and the growth of investment-mindedness of the people have made this possible. Capital market in India till the recent past, had all the characteristics of an underdeveloped economy. It was characterized by the conspicuous absence of institutions like, professional promoters, investment or issue houses, underwriting agencies and financial intermediaries. As a result, free flow of savings to industrial investment was impeded resulting in the stagnant character of our economy. Thus, serious flaws existed in the structure of capital market in India. However, the achievement of independence in 1947 marked a trend towards an organized growth of capital market. After achieving political independence, government took over the responsibility of giving shape to those coveted ideals of our economy, which were enshrined in our Constitution by way of the Directive Principles of state policy. When the Constitution was framed, the government defined its basic economic and social goals that were later on summed up in the expression “socialist pattern of society”.

These basic objectives had a significant bearing on the organization of the Capital Market. But it required effective control on government over the distribution of credit and finance and thus it could not be isolatedfrom the strategy of economic development.In the post independence days, the government had committed itself to reorganize the Indian Capital Market. The government’s commitments towards industrialization also required the removal of basic deficiencies of the capital market. The existing financial institutions could only partly meet the financial requirements of industries. Priority now shifted from private ownership to public control. The first amongst these actions was the nationalization of RBI in 1948. The setting up of the SBI followed this, by taking over the Imperial Bank of India in 1956. In the same year the government also took a drastic action by rationalizing and merging as many as 245 life insurance companies into a state owned monolithic LIC of India. The year 1969 represents a landmark in the history of public control of private financial institutions when the 14 major Commercial Banks were nationalized."

However, in mid-1960s, commodity futures trading in most of the commodities was banned and futures trading continued in two minor commodities, viz, pepper and turmeric.The Khusro Committee (June 1980) had recommended reintroduction of futures trading in most of the major commodities , including cotton, kapas, raw jute and jute goods and suggested that steps may be taken for introducing futures trading in commodities, like potatoes, onions, etc. at appropriate time. The government, accordingly initiated futures trading in Potato during the latter half of 1980, in a few markets in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Futures trading were also resumed in castorseed, and gur (jaggery), and in 1992, extended to Hessian (Jute). After the introduction of economic reforms in June 1991 and the consequent trade and industry liberalization in both the domestic and external sectors, the Govt. of India appointed in June 1993, a committee on Forward Markets under the Chairmanship of Prof. K.N. Kabra. The Committee submitted its report in September 1994. The majority view of the Committee was that futures trading be introduced in Basmati Rice, Cotton and Kapas, Raw Jute and Jute Goods, Groundnut, rapeseed/ mustard seed, cottonseed, sesame seed, sunflower seed, safflower seed, copra and soybean oilseeds, oils and their oilcakes, Rice bran oil, Castor oil and its oilcake, Linseed, Silver and Onion. The Committee also recommended that some of the existing commodity exchanges particularly those with futures trading in pepper and castor seed, may be upgraded to the level of international futures markets. In April 1999, futures trading was permitted in various edible oilseed complexes."

However, in mid-1960s, commodity futures trading in most of the commodities was banned and futures trading continued in two minor commodities, viz, pepper and turmeric.The Khusro Committee (June 1980) had recommended reintroduction of futures trading in most of the major commodities , including cotton, kapas, raw jute and jute goods and suggested that steps may be taken for introducing futures trading in commodities, like potatoes, onions, etc. at appropriate time. The government, accordingly initiated futures trading in Potato during the latter half of 1980, in a few markets in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Futures trading were also resumed in castorseed, and gur (jaggery), and in 1992, extended to Hessian (Jute). After the introduction of economic reforms in June 1991 and the consequent trade and industry liberalization in both the domestic and external sectors, the Govt. of India appointed in June 1993, a committee on Forward Markets under the Chairmanship of Prof. K.N. Kabra. The Committee submitted its report in September 1994. The majority view of the Committee was that futures trading be introduced in Basmati Rice, Cotton and Kapas, Raw Jute and Jute Goods, Groundnut, rapeseed/ mustard seed, cottonseed, sesame seed, sunflower seed, safflower seed, copra and soybean oilseeds, oils and their oilcakes, Rice bran oil, Castor oil and its oilcake, Linseed, Silver and Onion. The Committee also recommended that some of the existing commodity exchanges particularly those with futures trading in pepper and castor seed, may be upgraded to the level of international futures markets. In April 1999, futures trading was permitted in various edible oilseed complexes."

A relatively increasing value of velocity could be seen as a representative indicator of an efficient financial sector.

The fragmented regulatory architecture has led to a loss of scale and scope that could be available from a seamless financial market with all its attendant benefits of minimising the intermediation cost. For instance, complex financial intermediation by financial conglomerates of today falls under the purview of multiple regulators with gaps and overlaps. A number of expert committees have pointed out these discrepancies, and recommended the need for revisiting the financial sector legislations to rectify them. The need for complete review of the existing financial sector laws has been underlined to make the Indian financial sector more vibrant and dynamic in an increasingly interconnected world.The remit of FSLRC, as contained in its Terms of Reference (ToR), comprises the following:Review, simplify and rewrite the legislations affecting the financial"

The broad contour of that framework was outlined in the Approach Paper released by the Commission in October 2012.The Approach Paper emphasised the following:A uniform legal process for the financial sector regulators emphasising rule of law.A well-articulated principles-based approach to primary legislation emphasising a sound body of subordinate legislation based on these laws."

The division is responsible for formulating the policies related to the orderly growth and development of the securities markets (i.e. share, debt and derivatives) as well as protecting the interest of the investors. In particular, it is responsible for (i) institutional reforms in the securities markets, (ii) building regulatory and market institutions, (iii) strengthening investor protection mechanism, and (iv) providing efficient legislative framework for securities markets, such as Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (SEBI Act, 1992); Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956; and the Depositories Act, 1996.

Soon after independence, a complex web of controls were imposed for all external transactions through a legislation i.e., Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA), 1947. These were put into a more rigorous framework of controls through FERA, 1973. Severe restrictions on current account transactions had continued till mid-1990s when relaxations were made in the operations of the FERA, 1973. The control framework was essentially transaction based in terms of which all transactions in foreign exchange including those between residents and non-residents were prohibited, unless specifically permitted."
